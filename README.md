![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/workflows/Continuous%20Integration%20-%20Main/Release/badge.svg)

**Online Boutique** is a **platform-independent** microservices demo application. The application is a web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items, add them to the cart, and purchase them.

This version demonstrates modern microservices architecture with **complete platform independence** - runs on **any cloud** (GCP, AWS, Azure) or **on-premises**. Features [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) for distributed tracing, [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) for inter-service communication, and containerized deployment with Docker Compose.

**üéØ Key Features:**
- üåê **Platform Independent**: Deploy on GCP, AWS, Azure, or on-premises
- üîç **Open Source Observability**: Jaeger distributed tracing (no vendor lock-in)
- üèóÔ∏è **13 Microservices**: Multi-language architecture (Go, Python, Node.js, Java, C#)
- üöÄ **Production Ready**: Real-world patterns, health checks, and monitoring
- üê≥ **Container Native**: Docker & Kubernetes ready
- üìä **Full Observability**: OpenTelemetry integration with Jaeger UI

If you're using this demo, please **‚òÖStar** this repository to show your interest!

## Architecture

**Online Boutique** is composed of 11 microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC.

## Quickstart (Azure AKS)

1. Ensure you have the following requirements:
   - [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).
   - Shell environment with `az`, `git`, and `kubectl`.

2. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/danielpotter97/online-boutique.git
   cd online-boutique/
   ```

3. **üöÄ Quick Start with Open Source Observability (Recommended)**:
   ```sh
   # Start with Jaeger distributed tracing (no cloud setup needed!)
   ./start-local.sh
   ```
   
   **Access Points:**
   - üõçÔ∏è **Online Boutique**: http://localhost:8080
   - üìä **Jaeger Tracing UI**: http://localhost:16686
   
   This gives you the full experience with zero configuration!

4. **Alternative: Azure Deployment**
## üåê Platform Independence

**Online Boutique is now completely platform-independent!** Deploy anywhere:

### Supported Platforms:
- **‚òÅÔ∏è Google Cloud Platform** - GKE, Cloud Run, Compute Engine
- **‚òÅÔ∏è Amazon Web Services** - EKS, ECS, EC2
- **‚òÅÔ∏è Microsoft Azure** - AKS, Container Instances, Virtual Machines  
- **üè¢ On-Premises** - Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, bare metal
- **üíª Local Development** - Docker Compose

### Quick Platform Deployment:

#### Any Cloud with Kubernetes:
```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes-manifests/
```

#### Docker Compose (Universal):
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Helm Chart (Any Kubernetes):
```bash
helm install online-boutique ./helm-chart
```

See the **[Platform-Independent Guide](./PLATFORM-INDEPENDENT-GUIDE.md)** for detailed deployment instructions.

   Follow the [Azure Deployment Guide](./AZURE-DEPLOYMENT.md) for cloud deployment with Azure Application Insights.

5. **Manual Docker Compose** (if you prefer):
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## Platform-Independent Kubernetes Deployment

> üí° **Recommended**: This application is now platform-independent and can be deployed on any Kubernetes cluster (GCP GKE, AWS EKS, Azure AKS, or on-premises).

1. Ensure you have the following requirements:
   - A Kubernetes cluster on your preferred platform
   - `kubectl` configured to connect to your cluster
   - `git` for cloning the repository

2. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/microservices-demo.git
   cd microservices-demo/
   ```

3. Deploy Online Boutique to your cluster:

   ```sh
   kubectl apply -f ./kubernetes-manifests
   ```

4. Wait for the pods to be ready:

   ```sh
   kubectl get pods
   ```

5. Access the web frontend in a browser using the frontend's external IP:

   ```sh
   kubectl get service frontend-external | awk '{print $4}'
   ```

   **Note**: If using a local cluster (minikube, kind), you may need to use port-forwarding:
   ```sh
   kubectl port-forward deployment/frontend 8080:8080
   ```
   Then visit http://localhost:8080

6. **[Optional]** Clean up:

   ```sh
   kubectl delete -f ./kubernetes-manifests
   ```

## Original GKE Quickstart (Legacy)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The instructions below are for the original GCP-specific version. For platform independence, use the deployment guide above.

<details>
<summary>Click to expand GKE-specific instructions</summary>

1. Ensure you have the following requirements:
   - [Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project).
   - Shell environment with `gcloud`, `git`, and `kubectl`.

2. Set the Google Cloud project and region and ensure the Google Kubernetes Engine API is enabled.

   ```sh
   export PROJECT_ID=<PROJECT_ID>
   export REGION=us-central1
   gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com \
   kubectl apply -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
   ```

5. Wait for the pods to be ready.

   ```sh
   kubectl get pods
   ```

   After a few minutes, you should see the Pods in a `Running` state:

   ```

   ```

7. Access the web frontend in a browser using the frontend's external IP.

   ```sh
   kubectl get service frontend-external | awk '{print $4}'
   ```

   Visit `http://EXTERNAL_IP` in a web browser to access your instance of Online Boutique.

6. Congrats! You've deployed the platform-independent Online Boutique. To deploy with additional features (e.g., observability, service mesh, etc.), see [Deploy Online Boutique variations with Kustomize](#deploy-online-boutique-variations-with-kustomize).

7. Once you are done with it, clean up the deployment.

   ```sh
   kubectl delete -f ./release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
   ```
